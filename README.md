# The Everything Remote

A smart universal remote powered by an ESP32 and ESPHome â€” no soldering, no coding required. Designed to control Home Assistant devices via button presses, The Everything Remote is easy to customize and extend for your own needs.

This repo contains the YAML configuration files for ESPHome.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- 24 configurable buttons (single press + long press)
- Works over Wi-Fi using ESPHome
- Sends `button_pressed` events to Home Assistant
- Deep sleep support for ultra-low power usage
- Supports `select`, `back`, `play/pause`, volume, brightness, navigation, and more
- Simple GPIO-based design (can be adapted to your own button layout)

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

This project assumes you're using the [custom PCB](https://www.thestockpot.net/videos/theeverythingremote) and button matrix from the original build. However, you can adapt the software to any ESP32 board and button configuration.

**Minimum:**

- ESP32 (e.g., ESP32 DevKit v1)
- 24 momentary push buttons
- GPIO pins (see pinout below)
- Optional: touch input pin for waking from deep sleep

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Each button triggers an event via ESPHomeâ€™s `homeassistant.event` component. These events can then be used in Home Assistant to control anything â€” lights, media players, automations, etc.

Example:

```yaml
- platform: gpio
  pin: GPIO22
  id: select_button
  on_click:
    then:
      - homeassistant.event:
          event: esphome.button_pressed
          data:
            button: select
            type: single
